| **Recaster for Linux (tar.gz)** |  {{version}} | [recaster-install-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/impleotv/recaster-release/releases/download/{{version}}/recaster-install-linux.tar.gz)  | 

*Released on {{date}}*


The installation and configuration instructions can be found [here](https://impleotv.com/content/recaster/help/).

Application requires Nodejs 18.20.2 LTS.

> Note: To enable video preview functionality, GStreamer must be installed. The Docker image includes GStreamer pre-installed, eliminating the need for additional installations.


> Offline installation: When starting the application with a .bat or .sh command, it checks if the node_modules folder exists. If it doesn't exist, the script automatically downloads the dependencies and creates the folder. Therefore, if your target machine lacks an internet connection, execute this command first on a machine connected to the internet, then copy the node_modules directory to your offline machine.


## Docker

Use the docker-compose.yml file that accompanies the release, or use the following command to run the Docker image:

```sh
docker run -d \
    --name recaster \
    --restart always \
    -e PORT=5000 \  
    -v $(pwd)/data/:/recaster/data/ \
    -v recasterdb:/recaster/db/ \
    -v recasterlic:/recaster/licenses/ \
    --network host \
    impleo/recaster:{{ver}}
```

## Known issues:

Some antivirus programs generate false positive reports (for Windows) on the Stanag2WebRtc.eve executable, compiled in Golang.

There is very little that we can do about it...
